# Spotify-data-ETL-using-python-and-Airflow
### Start
* The process begins with the initiation of the ETL workflow in Apache Airflow
### Extract
* Spotify API: The workflow triggers Python scripts that call the Spotify API to fetch data. This could include data like track information, playlists, user data, etc.
#### Fetch data from Spotify API
### Transform
* #### Data Cleaning: Raw data from Spotify is cleaned and formatted. This step might involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data into a consistent format.
* #### Data Enrichment: Enhance the data with additional calculations or merging it with other data sources for a more comprehensive dataset.
* #### Data Validation: Ensuring the transformed data meets certain quality standards before loading it into the destination.
### Load
* #### Database/Storage: The transformed and validated data is loaded into a designated storage system. This could be a database like PostgreSQL, a data warehouse, or even a file storage system depending on the project requirements. 
#### Monitoring & Logging
#### Success/Failure notifications
* #### Success/Failure Notification: Apache Airflow provides monitoring and logging capabilities to track the success or failure of the ETL process. Notifications might be set up to alert administrators of any issues.
#### Log storage
#### Log Storage: Detailed logs are stored for debugging and auditing purposes.
### End
#### The workflow concludes until it is triggered again, which could be on a schedule or due to a specific event.
The flow goes as follows: Start → Extract → Transform → Load → Monitoring & Logging → End.
